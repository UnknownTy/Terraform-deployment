In order to install use the database you must manually assign the schema to it first.
To do this you can do the following:

1. Uncomment the EC2 Test Instance at the bottom of the EC2 Module
2. Terraform Apply to create the new Test Instance
3. SSH into the Test Instance in your preferred method
4. Use the command `sudo yum install mysql -y`
5. Copy and paste the MySQL_dump_command from the terraform output into the EC2 Instance's Terminal
6. Enter the RDS' Password

All done! The RDS database now has the schema attached to it.
You can now re-comment the EC2 instance and terraform apply to remove it from AWS.
